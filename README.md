# Lead-Score-Case-Study

## Objective

An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. 
On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their websites and browse for courses.
The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses fill up a form for the course, or watch some videos.
When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also gets Lead_data through past referrals. Once these Lead_data are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the Lead_data get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%.
There are a lot of Lead_data generated in the initial stage (top) but only a few of them come out as paying customers from the bottom. In the middle stage, you need to nurture the potential Lead_data well (i.e. educating the Lead_data about the product, constantly communicating, etc. ) to get a higher lead conversion. X Education has appointed you to help them select the most promising Lead_data, i.e. the Lead_data that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires you to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the Lead_data such that the customers with higher lead scores have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead scores have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

### Goals of the Case Study:
To build a logistic regression model to assign lead score between 0 to 100 to each of the Lead_data which can be used by the company to target potential Lead_data. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e., is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will not get converted.
